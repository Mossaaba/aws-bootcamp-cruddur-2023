# Week 1 — App Containerization




### Hand-On

1. Create a new GitHub repo and lunch the week-1 with gitPod :

(Unlock the port)

- Run the server localy and getting the json response:

3. Launch the repo within a Gitpod workspace
4. Configure Gitpod.yml configuration, eg. I’m VSCode Extensions
5. Clone the frontend and backend repo
6. Explore the codebases
7. Ensure we can get the apps running locally
8. Write a Dockerfile for each app
9. Ensure we get the apps running via individual container
10. Create a docker-compose file
11. Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
12. Mount directories so we can make changes while we code



### Homework chalanges 


1. Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
2. Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
3. Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
4. Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
5. Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
6. Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
7. Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
